Problem B. Battlefield

You are playing a game where the battlefield consists of N cities and R
bidirectional roads. Your goal is to start at some city C of your choice and
visit all R roads exactly once ending this trip at C. If this is not possible
you must add the minimum number of additional roads to the initial set of
roads to make this trip feasible. Please note that there might be more than
one road connecting the same pair of cities and that you are allowed to add
roads between any pair of cities regardless of whether they already had roads
connecting them or not as shown in the sample input/output.

Input

The first line of input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases
follow. For each test case there will be:

One line containing the value N, the number of cities.
One line containing the value R, the number of roads.
R lines corresponding to the roads. Each contains 2 values A and B separated
by one space. A and B are 2 distinct integers (0 ≤ A,B < N) indicating the end
points of that road.
Output

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: ", where x is the
number of the test case, followed by the minimum number of roads needed.
